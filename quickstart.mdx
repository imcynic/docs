# Quick Start Guide

Get your 04Scapes development environment set up and running in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through the installation process and show you how to start the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Node.js 22+">
    Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Later LTS versions are recommended.
    
    ```bash
    node --version  # Should show v22.0.0 or higher
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Java 17+ (JDK)">
    Required for client tools and cache processing. Install from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
    
    ```bash
    java -version  # Should show version 17 or higher
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Git (optional)">
    For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/2004scape/Server.git 04scapes-engine
    cd 04scapes-engine
    ```
    
    Or download and extract the ZIP file from GitHub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    The engine uses Bun as its runtime, but npm/yarn also work:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Initial Setup">
    Execute the quickstart script which will guide you through configuration:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Windows
      quickstart.bat
      ```
      
      ```bash Linux/macOS
      ./quickstart.sh
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    The script will:
    - Check your dependencies
    - Set up the database
    - Pack the cache files
    - Configure environment variables
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First Run

Once setup is complete, start the server:

```bash
npm start
# or
bun run src/app.ts
```

<Note>
  Wait for the message "World ready" before attempting to connect. The first startup may take several minutes as cache files are generated.
</Note>

## Accessing the Game

The server includes a built-in web client:

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
2. Click "Play Now" 
3. Create an account or log in
4. Start playing!

## Development Mode

For active development, use the development server which automatically restarts on code changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This enables:
- Hot reloading for engine code
- Automatic script recompilation
- Detailed debug logging
- File watching for configs

## Common Commands

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Start Server
  npm start
  ```
  
  ```bash Development Mode
  npm run dev
  ```
  
  ```bash Build Cache
  npm run build
  ```
  
  ```bash Run Tests
  npm test
  ```
  
  ```bash Database Migration
  npm run db:migrate
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='"java" is not recognized'>
    **Solution**: Install Java 17+ and ensure it's in your PATH, or set `JAVA_PATH` in your `.env` file:
    ```
    JAVA_PATH=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.5.8-hotspot\bin\java.exe
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Class file version error">
    **Problem**: Using Java 8 or 11 instead of 17+
    
    **Solution**: Install Java 17+ from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/). If you have multiple Java versions, specify the path in `.env`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    **Problem**: Port 8080 or 43594 is already in use
    
    **Solution**: Change ports in your `.env` file:
    ```
    WEB_PORT=8080
    GAME_PORT=43594
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database connection errors">
    **Problem**: Cannot connect to database
    
    **Solution**: Check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. For local development, SQLite is recommended:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=file:./data/game.db
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
